# Risk Profile: Story 1.6

Date: 2025-09-17
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 3
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 0
- Risk Score: 85/100

## Risk Distribution

- Security: 1 (medium)
- Reliability: 1 (medium)
- Maintainability: 1 (low)

## Detailed Risk Register

1. TECH-001: Missing field whitelist could allow unintended PATCH data
   - Probability: Medium (2)
   - Impact: Medium (2)
   - Score: 4 (Medium)
   - Mitigation: Explicit allowedUpdateFields (implemented); unit test to enforce

2. REL-001: Service error propagation might leak sensitive details
   - Probability: Low (1)
   - Impact: Medium (2)
   - Score: 2 (Low)
   - Mitigation: Sanitize error messages; make sure logger avoids secrets

3. MNT-001: Doc drift between README and testing guide
   - Probability: Medium (2)
   - Impact: Low (1)
   - Score: 2 (Low)
   - Mitigation: Link testing guide from README; PR checklist to update both

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

- Prioritize unit tests that validate field filtering and required mutable-field rule
- Run live smoke only when credentials present; verify no sensitive data in failures
