# Tasks: Ticket Update Reliability

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-specify-scripts-bash/`  
**Prerequisites**: `plan.md` (required), `spec.md` (required), `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`

**Tests**: Write targeted unit/integration tests where noted for critical ticket update paths. Ensure test tasks run before implementation tasks within each story phase.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

**Constitution Alignment**:
- Keep all work inside the existing backend TypeScript MCP server (`src/`); do not add new runtimes or frontends.
- Interact with Autotask strictly through approved REST endpoints respecting publish levels and data minimization.
- Maintain â‰¥80% overall test coverage and 100% coverage on ticket update flows via `npm run lint` and `npm test`.
- Enhance structured logging without exposing secrets; map Autotask failures to actionable responses.
- Reuse existing environment variables and document any new operational requirements in project docs.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

- [X] T001 Seed ticket metadata fixtures for tests in `tests/setup.ts` to expose cached status/priority helpers.
- [X] T002 Create integration test scaffold in `tests/integration/ticket-updates.integration.test.ts` with placeholder describe blocks.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

- [X] T003 Implement metadata cache module in `src/services/ticket-metadata.cache.ts` to load resources/statuses/priorities with refresh scheduling.
- [X] T004 Integrate metadata cache bootstrap and refresh wiring inside `AutotaskService` initialization in `src/services/autotask.service.ts`.
- [X] T005 Add ticket update validation and request builder utilities in `src/services/ticket-update.validator.ts`.
- [X] T006 Introduce structured error mapper scaffold in `src/utils/error-mapper.ts` returning `{ code, message, guidance }`.

**Checkpoint**: Metadata caching, validation helpers, and error scaffolding are ready for story work.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 â€“ Dispatch updates core ticket fields (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

**Goal**: Allow coordinators to reassign tickets and adjust status/priority through the assistant without leaving Autotask in an inconsistent state.  
**Independent Test**: From the MCP client, update a ticketâ€™s assigned resource, status, and priority; verify Autotask reflects all changes and tests in `tests/integration/ticket-updates.integration.test.ts` pass.

### Tests for User Story 1

- [X] T007 [P] [US1] Author failing unit specs covering combined field updates in `tests/unit/tool-handler.update-ticket.test.ts`.
- [X] T008 [P] [US1] Expand integration coverage for status/priority/assignment updates in `tests/integration/ticket-updates.integration.test.ts`.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T009 [US1] Refine `updateTicket` to build metadata-driven PATCH payloads with concurrency token support in `src/services/autotask.service.ts`.
- [X] T010 [US1] Apply validator and new assignment argument handling within the `update_ticket` branch of `src/handlers/tool.handler.ts`.
- [X] T011 [US1] Document updated ticket tool semantics in `src/mcp/server.ts` (tool descriptions and schema hints).
- [X] T012 [US1] Extend ticket type definitions to expose assignment/status/priority update shapes in `src/types/autotask.ts`.

**Checkpoint**: Ticket field updates succeed end-to-end with validation and tests.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 â€“ Technicians add contextual notes (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Allow technicians to submit internal and external notes with correct visibility directly via the assistant.  
**Independent Test**: Post one internal and one external note through the assistant; confirm Autotask visibility flags and see passing scenarios in `tests/integration/ticket-updates.integration.test.ts`.

### Tests for User Story 2

- [X] T013 [P] [US2] Add unit tests validating note visibility and length enforcement in `tests/unit/tool-handler.create-ticket-note.test.ts`.
- [X] T014 [P] [US2] Extend integration coverage for internal vs external notes in `tests/integration/ticket-updates.integration.test.ts`.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T015 [US2] Enforce publish level and length checks in `createTicketNote` within `src/services/autotask.service.ts`.
- [X] T016 [US2] Add note sanitization helpers to `src/services/ticket-update.validator.ts` for internal/external payloads.
- [X] T017 [US2] Update note handling branch to apply validator output and structured errors in `src/handlers/tool.handler.ts`.

**Checkpoint**: Notes created via assistant honor visibility settings with validated payloads.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 â€“ Operators receive actionable errors (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Surface clear, actionable feedback when Autotask rejects updates so operators can self-correct quickly.  
**Independent Test**: Trigger invalid status and permission errors via the assistant; observe mapped guidance in responses and logs while `tests/unit/utils/error-mapper.test.ts` passes.

### Tests for User Story 3

- [X] T018 [P] [US3] Create unit coverage for Autotask failure mappings in `tests/unit/utils/error-mapper.test.ts`.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T019 [US3] Implement detailed error mappings for common Autotask failures in `src/utils/error-mapper.ts`.
- [X] T020 [US3] Route ticket update and note creation failures through the mapper in `src/services/autotask.service.ts`.
- [X] T021 [US3] Propagate structured error responses and correlation IDs back to MCP clients in `src/handlers/tool.handler.ts`.
- [X] T022 [US3] Enhance logging to emit sanitized ticket metadata and guidance codes in `src/utils/logger.ts`.
- [X] T023 [US3] Document troubleshooting steps and expected error responses in `specs/001-specify-scripts-bash/quickstart.md`.

**Checkpoint**: Operators receive actionable errors; logs capture sanitized diagnostics.

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [X] T024 Summarize ticket update reliability changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- [X] T025 Execute lint and full Jest suites via scripts listed in `package.json`, confirming coverage thresholds.

---

## Phase N+1: Telemetry & Measurement

- [X] T026 Capture per-attempt structured logs for ticket updates and note creation (success and failure) in `src/services/autotask.service.ts` and `src/handlers/tool.handler.ts`, ensuring sanitized payload metadata and Autotask response details flow through `src/utils/logger.ts`.
- [X] T027 Extend `tests/integration/ticket-updates.integration.test.ts` to assert logging/metrics hooks fire with status, priority, assignment, and note operations, covering FR-006 and SC-001/SC-002 paths.
- [X] T028 Document operational runbook entries in `specs/001-specify-scripts-bash/quickstart.md` for monitoring 95% success rate, <5s note visibility, and tracking the 50% manual console reduction metric.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

| Predecessor | Successor | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| T001â€“T006 | T007â€“T017 | Metadata cache, validators, and error scaffolds must exist before implementing story logic |
| T007â€“T012 (US1) | T013â€“T017 (US2) | Note work depends on validated update pipeline from US1 |
| T013â€“T017 (US2) | T018â€“T023 (US3) | Error mapping enhances both update and note flows established earlier |
| T018â€“T023 | T024â€“T028 | Observability, polish, and telemetry finish after functional changes land |

- **Story Order**: US1 (P1) â†’ US2 (P1) â†’ US3 (P2); each remains independently testable once its predecessors finish.
- **Cross-Cutting**: Polish and telemetry tasks T024â€“T028 wrap up once all user stories close.

---

## Parallel Opportunities

- T007 and T008 can run concurrently with different test targets once foundational utilities exist.
- T013 and T014 operate on distinct test files; execute in parallel after US1 completes.
- T018 may begin after T006, independently of US2 implementation tasks.
- T026 and T027 can pair once US3 logging hooks land, with doc updates (T028) trailing in parallel.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)
1. Finish Setup + Foundational phases (T001â€“T006).
2. Deliver US1 tasks T007â€“T012 to restore ticket field updates.
3. Validate via integration tests before proceeding to additional stories.

### Incremental Delivery
1. Complete MVP (US1) and release if urgent.
2. Layer US2 tasks T013â€“T017 to enable note handling.
3. Add US3 tasks T018â€“T023 for error experience improvements.
4. Finalize with polish and telemetry tasks (T024â€“T028).

### Parallel Team Strategy
1. One contributor finalizes foundational work while another seeds test scaffolds.
2. Assign separate developers to US1 and US2 once foundation merges; US3 can begin after validator and mapper scaffolds (T005â€“T006) are ready.
3. Combine for polish tasks, telemetry instrumentation, and final regression.
