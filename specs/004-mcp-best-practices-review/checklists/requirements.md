# Specification Quality Checklist: MCP Best Practices Compliance

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… **PASSED** - All quality checks passed

### Detailed Review:

1. **Content Quality**: All sections focus on user outcomes and business value. No TypeScript, MCP SDK, or Autotask API implementation details in requirements. Success criteria describe user-facing metrics (tool discovery, validation errors, response times) rather than internal mechanisms.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 15 functional requirements are testable ("MUST include", "MUST support", "MUST format"). No ambiguous language. Success criteria include specific metrics (100%, 25,000 characters, 100ms). Edge cases address key boundary conditions.

3. **Feature Readiness**: Each user story has clear acceptance scenarios using Given/When/Then format. Stories are prioritized (P1-P3) and independently testable. Success criteria map directly to user stories (SC-001 for P1, SC-002 for P2, etc.).

4. **No Clarifications Needed**: All requirements have reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section (Markdown format, character limit, default response format). No critical decisions require user input.

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` - no updates required
- All user stories are independently implementable and testable
- Success criteria provide clear pass/fail thresholds for each requirement
- Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries (code refactoring, server renaming, resource changes)
